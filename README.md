# Ultrawide Support for Chained Echoes

Ever wished you could play Chained Echoes in ultrawide? Well, now you can!

## Features

-   Unlocks ultrawide resolutions for Chained Echoes!
-   **ZERO CONFIGURATION REQUIRED!** Simply install and you'll have ultrawide unlocked with ease! Ultrawide Support automatically detects the optimal resolution for your monitor and forces the game to adjust to its aspect ratio at runtime.
-   Verified working on the latest Xbox/Microsoft/Windows store version of the game (v1.052 at time of writing).
-   Adds ultrawide optimisations for various UI elements. This feature is still a work in progress as I am still actively playing through the game for the first time! Whenever I encounter something that needs tweaking I'll release a fix, so make sure to check back regularly for updates!

## Notes

-   The start menu will still be 16:9 for aesthetic purposes.
-   It's normal for there to be black bars at the sides of the screen during certain scenes.
-   You're gonna see some things that the developer didn't intend you to see!
-   This mod is a work in progress, updates will be released regularly.
