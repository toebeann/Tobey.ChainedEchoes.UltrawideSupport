# Ultrawide Support for Chained Echoes

Ever wished you could play Chained Echoes in ultrawide? Well, now you can!

## Features

-   Unlocks ultrawide resolutions for Chained Echoes!
-   **ZERO CONFIGURATION REQUIRED!** Simply install and you'll have ultrawide unlocked with ease! Ultrawide Support automatically detects the optimal resolution for your monitor and forces the game to adjust to its aspect ratio at runtime.
-   Verified working on the latest Xbox/Microsoft/Windows store version of the game (v1.052 at time of writing).
-   Adds ultrawide optimisations for various UI elements. This feature is still a work in progress as I am still actively playing through the game for the first time! Whenever I encounter something that needs tweaking I'll release a fix, so make sure to check back regularly for updates!

## Installation

1. Install [BepInEx for Chained Echoes](https://github.com/toebeann/BepInEx.ChainedEchoes)

    BepInEx is a mod loader for Chained Echoes

2. Download and extract the contents of `Ultrawide Support.zip` into `<game folder>\BepInEx`.

    If you did it right, `Tobey.ChainedEchoes.UltrawideSupport.dll` should be located within `<game folder>\BepInEx\plugins`.

3. Launch the game and have fun!
